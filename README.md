Trust is one of the most important factors while interacting with robots- too much trust can lead increased reliance on robot while too little trust can result in decreased situation awareness. There are assessments of trust post interaction, however, to increase the efficiency in the manufacturing setting, a dynamic approach is needed. There would be a model developed for trust prediction
